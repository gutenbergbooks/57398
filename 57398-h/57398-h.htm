  <h2 class='c005'>EDUCATION OF WOMEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The higher education of women in America is taking place
before our eyes on a vast scale and in a variety of ways.
Every phase of this great experiment, if experiment we choose
to call it, may be studied almost simultaneously. Women
are taking advantage of all the various kinds of education
offered them in great and ever-increasing numbers, and the
period of thirty years, or thereabouts, that has elapsed since
the beginning of the movement is sufficient to authorize us
in drawing certain definite conclusions. The higher education
of women naturally divides itself into college education
designed primarily to train the mental faculties by
means of a liberal education, and only secondarily, to equip the
student for self-support, and professional or special education,
directed primarily toward one of the money-making
occupations.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>COLLEGE EDUCATION</h3>

<p class='c008'>Women’s college education is carried on in three different
classes of institutions: coeducational colleges, independent
women’s colleges and women’s colleges connected more or
less closely with some one of the colleges for men.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>1. Coeducation</b>—Coeducation is the prevailing system of
college education in the United States for both men and
women. In the western states and territories it is almost
the only system of education, and it is rapidly becoming the
prevailing system in the south, where the influence of the
state universities is predominant. On the other hand, in the
New England and middle states the great majority of the
youth of both sexes are still receiving a separate college
education. Coeducation was introduced into colleges in
the west as a logical consequence of the so-called American
system of free elementary and secondary schools.
During the great school revival of 1830–45 and the ensuing
years until the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>elementary and secondary schools were established throughout
New England and the middle states and such western
states as existed in those days. It was a fortunate circumstance
for girls that the country was at that time sparsely
settled; in most neighborhoods it was so difficult to establish
and secure pupils for even one grammar school and one
high school that girls were admitted from the first to both<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
In the reorganization of lower and higher education that took
place between 1865 and 1870 this same system, bringing with
it the complete coeducation of the sexes, was introduced
throughout the south both for whites and negroes, and was
extended to every part of the west. In no part of the
country, except in a few large eastern cities, was any distinction
made in elementary or secondary education between
boys and girls<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. The second fortunate and in like manner
almost accidental factor in the education of American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>women was the occurrence of the civil war at the formative
period of the public schools, with the result of placing
the elementary and secondary education of both boys and
girls overwhelmingly in the hands of women teachers.
In no other country of the world has this ever been the
case, and its influence upon women’s education has
been very great. The five years of the civil war, which
drained all the northern and western states of men,
caused women teachers to be employed in the public
and private schools in large numbers, and in the first
reports of the national bureau of education, organized
after the war, we see that there were already fewer men
than women teaching in the public schools of the United
States. This result proved not to be temporary, but permanent,
and from 1865 until the present time not only the
elementary teaching of boys and girls but the secondary
education of both has been increasingly in the hands of
women<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. When most of the state universities of the west
were founded they were in reality scarcely more than secondary
schools supplemented, in most cases, by large preparatory
departments. Girls were already being educated with
boys in all the high schools of the west, and not to admit
them to the state universities would have been to break with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>tradition. Women were also firmly established as teachers
in the secondary schools and it was patent to all thoughtful
men that they must be given opportunities for higher education,
if only for the sake of the secondary education of
the boys of the country.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The development of women’s
education in the east has followed a different course because
there were in the east no state universities, and the private
colleges for men had been founded before women were suffered
to become either pupils or teachers in schools. The
admission of women to the existing eastern colleges was,
therefore, as much an innovation as it would have been in
Europe. The coeducation of men and women in colleges,
and at the same time the college education of women, began
in Ohio, the earliest settled of the western states. In 1833
Oberlin collegiate institute (not chartered as a college until
1850) was opened, admitting from the first both men and
women. Oberlin was at that time, and is now, hampered
by maintaining a secondary school as large as its college
department, but it was the first institution for collegiate
instruction in the United States where large numbers of
men and women were educated together, and the uniformly
favorable testimony of its faculty had great influence on
the side of coeducation. In 1853 Antioch college, also in
Ohio, was opened, and admitted from the beginning men
and women on equal terms. Its first president, Horace
Mann, was one of the most brilliant and energetic educational
leaders in the United States, and his ardent advocacy
of coeducation, based on his own practical experience, had
great weight with the public.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a> From this time on it became
a custom, as state universities were opened in the far west,
to admit women. Utah, opened in 1850, Iowa, opened in
1856, Washington, opened in 1862, Kansas, opened in 1866,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Minnesota, opened in 1868, and Nebraska, opened in 1871,
were coeducational from the outset. Indiana, opened as
early as 1820, admitted women in 1868. The state University
of Michigan was, at this time, the most important western
university, and the only western university well known
in the east before the war. When, in 1870, it opened its
doors to women, they were for the first time in America
admitted to instruction of true college grade. The step
was taken in response to public sentiment, as shown by
two requests of the state legislature, against the will of
the faculty as a whole. The example of the University
of Michigan was quickly followed by all the other state universities
of the west. In the same year women were allowed
to enter the state universities of Illinois and California; in
1873 the only remaining state university closed to women,
that of Ohio, admitted them. Wisconsin which, since 1860,
had given some instruction to women, became in 1874 unreservedly
coeducational. All the state universities of the
west, organized since 1871, have admitted women from the
first. In the twenty states which, for convenience, I shall
classify as western, there are now twenty state universities
open to women, and, in four territories, Arizona, Oklahoma,
Indiana and New Mexico, the one university of each territory
is open to women. Of the eleven state universities of the
southern states the two most western admitted women first,
as was to be expected. Missouri became coeducational as
early as 1870, and the University of Texas was opened in
1883 as a coeducational institution. Mississippi admitted
women in 1882, Kentucky in 1889, Alabama in 1893, South
Carolina in 1894, North Carolina in 1897, but only to
women prepared to enter the junior and senior years, West
Virginia in 1897.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> The state universities of Virginia,
Georgia and Louisiana are still closed. The one state
university existing outside the west and south, that of
Maine, admitted women in 1872.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The greater part of the college education of the United
States, however, is carried on in private, not in state universities.
In 1897 over 70 per cent of all the college students in
the United States were studying in private colleges, so that
for women’s higher education their admission to private
colleges is really a matter of much greater importance.
The part taken by Cornell university in New York state
in opening private colleges to women was as significant
as the part taken by Michigan in opening state universities.
Cornell is in a restricted sense a state university, inasmuch
as part of its endowment, like that of the state
universities, is derived from state and national funds. Nevertheless,
there is little reason to suppose that Cornell
would have admitted women had it not been for the
generosity of Henry W. Sage, who offered to build and
endow a large hall of residence for women at Cornell
university. After carefully investigating coeducation in
all the institutions where it then existed, and especially
in Michigan, the trustees of the university admitted
women in 1872. The example set by Cornell was followed
very slowly by the other private colleges of the New
England and middle states. For the next twenty years the
colleges in this section of the United States admitting
women might be counted on the fingers of one hand. In
Massachusetts Boston university opened its department of
arts in 1873, and admitted women to it from the first;
but no college for men followed the example of Boston until
1883, when the Massachusetts institute of technology, the
most important technical and scientific school in the state,
and one of the most important in the United States, admitted
women. This school, like Cornell, is supported in part
from state and national funds. Very recently, in 1892, Tufts
college was opened to women. In the west and south the
case is different, and the list of private colleges that one
after another have become coeducational is too long to be
inserted here. Among new coeducational foundations the
most important are, on the Pacific coast, the Leland Stanford
junior university, opened in 1891, and, in the middle
west, Chicago university, opened in 1892. To show the
differing attitude toward coeducation of the different sections
of the United States, I have arranged the 480 coeducational
colleges and separate colleges for men given in the
U.S. education report for 1897–98 in a table on the opposite
page. In matters like women’s education, which are powerfully
affected by prejudice and conservative opinion, we find
not only a sharp cleavage in opinion and practice between
the west and the east of the United States, but also distinct
phases of differing opinion, corresponding in the
main to the old geographical division of the states into
New England, middle, southern and western.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>In the western states it will be observed there are, excluding Roman
Catholic colleges and seminaries, out of 195 colleges 182 coeducational
and only 13 colleges for men only. All of these except 3 are denominational;
6 belong to the Lutheran, 1 to the Dutch Reformed, 1 to the German
Evangelical, 1 to the Episcopalian, and 1 to the Congregationalist.
The other 3 are, as we might expect, in the most eastern and the earliest
settled of the western states; one in Ohio, Western reserve, which teaches
women in a separate women’s college; one in Indiana, Wabash college,
one of the three most important colleges in Indiana; and one in Illinois,
Illinois college. Roman Catholic institutions apart, in 14 states and all
3 territories every college for men is open to women (the one university
of the territory of New Mexico, not included in the U. S. education
report, is open to women). In the southern states and southern middle
states there are, excluding Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries, out
of 161, 125 coeducational and only 36 colleges for men only. Among these
36, however, are the most important educational institution in Maryland,
the Johns Hopkins university; the most important in Georgia, the University
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of Georgia; in Louisiana the two most important, the Louisiana
state university and Tulane university, and in Virginia the very important
University of Virginia.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Roman Catholic institutions apart, all
the colleges in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida and West
Virginia are coeducational. In New England and the northern middle
states out of 64 colleges, excluding Roman Catholic colleges and
seminaries, only 29, or less than half, are coeducational. The colleges
for men only include (with the exception of Cornell) all the
largest undergraduate colleges in this section—Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
Princeton, Pennsylvania. Maine and Vermont are liberal to women,
2 colleges (3 if we count the limited coeducational college of Colby) in
Maine and 3 in Vermont being coeducational, but the total number of
students in college in these states is very small (in Maine only 843 men
and 189 women; in Vermont only 301 men and 99 women). The leading
colleges of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania are closed, and in Massachusetts only 2 are open and 7
closed.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of the four hundred and eighty colleges for men enumerated
by the commissioner of education 336, or 70 per cent
(or, excluding Catholic colleges, 80 per cent), admit women.
It would be misleading, however, to count among American
institutions for higher education, properly so-called,
most of the coeducational colleges and separate colleges
for men included in this list, and it would be equally
misleading to compare the number of women studying in
such colleges in the United States with the number of
women engaged in higher studies in England, France and
Germany.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In order to obtain a better idea of opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>for true collegiate work open to women at the present time
in the United States I have selected from these four hundred
and eighty colleges and from the numerous colleges for
women classified elsewhere, a list of fifty-eight colleges
properly so-called, employing for the purpose the four
means of classification most likely to commend themselves
to the impartial student of such things.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>fifty-eight colleges four are independent colleges for women
and three women’s colleges affiliated to colleges for men;
of the remaining 51, 30, or 58.8 per cent, are coeducational,
and a nearer examination makes a much more
favorable showing for coeducation. Of the 21 colleges
closed to women in their undergraduate departments five
have affiliated to them a women’s college through which
women obtain some share in the undergraduate instruction
given, the affiliated colleges in three cases being of
enough importance to appear in the same list. Of these
five, four (all but Harvard) admit women without restriction
to their graduate instruction, and in addition Yale,
the University of Pennsylvania and New York university
make no distinction between men and women in graduate
instruction. The Johns Hopkins university maintains a
coeducational medical school. In this list then of fifty-eight,
which includes all the most important colleges in the
United States, there are, apart from the two Catholic colleges,
only ten (Dartmouth, Amherst, Williams, Clark,
Princeton, Lehigh, Lafayette, Hamilton, Colgate, Virginia,
all situated on the Atlantic seaboard) to which women are
not admitted in some departments. Princeton is the only
one of the large university foundations that excludes women
from any share whatsoever in its advantages. The diagram
on the opposite page shows the steady progress of coeducation
from 1870 to 1898.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If Catholic colleges are excluded, as in the map opposite page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>, coeducational
colleges formed, in 1898, 80 per cent, and colleges for men only 20 per cent of the
whole number—a still more favorable result for coeducation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>All the arguments against the coeducation of the sexes
in colleges have been met and answered by experience. It
was feared at first that coeducation would lower the standard
of scholarship on account of the supposed inferior quality of
women’s minds. The unanimous experience in coeducational
colleges goes to show that the average standing of women is
slightly higher than the average standing of men.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>reasons for the greater success of women are given, such as
absence of the distraction of athletic sports, greater diligence,
higher moral standards, but the fact, however it may
be explained, remains and is as gratifying as astonishing to
those interested in women’s education. The question of health
has also been finally disposed of; thousands of women have
been working side by side with men in coeducational institutions
for the past twenty-five years and undergoing exactly
the same tests without a larger percentage of withdrawals on
account of illness than men. The question of conduct has
also been disposed of. None of the difficulties have arisen
that were feared from the association of men and women of
marriageable age. Looking at coeducation as a whole it is
most surprising that it has worked so well.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Perhaps the
only objection that may be made from men’s point of
view to coeducation in America is that it has succeeded
only too well and that the proportion of women students is
increasing too steadily. Not only is the number of coeducational
colleges increasing but the number of women relatively
to the number of men is increasing also. In 1890
there were studying in coeducational colleges 16,959 men
and 7,929 women; or women, in other words, formed 31.9
per cent of the whole body of students. In 1898 there were
28,823 men and 16,284 women studying in coeducational
colleges, women forming 36.1 per cent of the whole body
of students. Between 1890 and 1898 men in coeducational
colleges have increased 70.0 per cent, but women
in coeducational colleges have increased 105.4 per cent.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>There is every reason to suppose that this increase of
women will continue. Already girls form 56.5 per cent of
the pupils in all secondary schools and 13 per cent of the girls
enrolled and only 10 per cent of the boys enrolled graduate
from the public high schools. It is sometimes said that
men students, as a rule, dislike the presence of women, and
in especial that they are unwilling to compete for prizes
against women for the very reason that the average standing
of women is higher than their own. If there is any
force in this statement, however, it would seem that men
should increase less rapidly in coeducational colleges than
in separate colleges for men. The reverse, however, is
the case. During the eight years from 1890 to 1898 men
have increased in coeducational colleges 70.0 per cent, but
in separate colleges for men only 34.7 per cent.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a> This is all
the more remarkable, because in the separate colleges for
men are included the large undergraduate departments of
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia and the University of
Pennsylvania. It is women who have shown a preference
for separate education; women have increased more rapidly
in separate colleges for women than in coeducational colleges.
It will be observed, however, that the separate colleges for
women, like the separate colleges for men included in my
list of fifty-eight, are in the east; it is in the east only that
any preference for separate education is shown by either
sex.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>III. Elmira college, the Randolph-Macon Woman’s college,
Rockford college and Mills college are here relegated
to a third group because of certain common characteristics.
Their endowment is wholly inadequate, averaging considerably
less than $50,000 apiece, reaching $100,000 only in
the case of the Randolph-Macon Woman’s college. In each
of them a disproportionate number of students is studying
in the music or art department; special students form too
large a proportion of the whole number of students; the
number of professors is too small to permit college classes to
be conducted by specialists; the college classes are too
small; true college training cannot be obtained in very small
classes, and moreover, in view of the increasing number of
women now going to college, when a college for women
does not grow steadily it is reasonable to assume that there
must be some good reason for its lack of growth.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Elmira college</b>, situated at Elmira, New York, has, apart from
the president, 10 academic instructors (7 women, 2 without first
degree; 3 men); 5 teachers of music, 2 of art. There are studying
in the college 70 regular college students, 17 specials and 61 special
students in music.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>The Randolph-Macon Woman’s college</b>, situated at Lynchburg,
Virginia, has, apart from the president, 12 academic instructors
(2 Ph. D.s.)—7 women, 2 without first degree; 5 men; 9
instructors in music. Of the 226 students,<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a> 55 are regular college
students; 44 registered for degree but spending one-fifth of time in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>music or preparatory work; 16 special students; 6 students of art;
49 preparatory students; 46 students of music.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Rockford college, Rockford, Illinois</b>—Opened as seminary,
1849; chartered as college, 1892; 13 academic instructors (2 Ph.
D.s.)—all women, 3 without first degree; 4 teachers of music, 1 of
art; 35 college s.; 7 special s.; 70 s. in music only.</p>

<p class='c016'><b>Mills college, California</b>—Opened as seminary, 1871; chartered
as college, 1885; 11 instructors (9 women, 3 without first
degree; 2 men); 8 teachers of music; 22 college s.; 135 pupils in
preparatory department.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the existing colleges belonging to these
groups, a separate college for women, Trinity, meant to be
of true college grade, will soon be opened in Washington
under the control of the Roman Catholic church.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is often assumed by the adversaries of coeducation that
independent colleges for women may be trusted to introduce
a course of study modified especially for women,
but the experience, both of coeducational colleges that
have devised women’s courses and of women’s colleges,
demonstrates conclusively that women themselves refuse to
regard as satisfactory any modification whatsoever of the
usual academic course. At the opening of Vassar college
itself it is clear that the trustees and faculty made an honest
attempt to discover and introduce certain modifications in
the system of intellectual training then in operation in the
best colleges for men. They planned from the start to
give much more time to accomplishments—music, drawing
and painting—than was given in men’s colleges, and
the example of Vassar in this respect was followed ten years
later by Wellesley and Smith. These accomplishments have
gradually fallen out of the course of women’s colleges;
neither Vassar nor Wellesley allows time spent in them to
be counted toward the bachelor’s degree. Smith alone of
the colleges of group I still permits nearly one-sixth of the
whole college course to be devoted to them. Bryn Mawr,
which opened ten years later than Smith or Wellesley,
from the beginning found it possible to exclude them from
its course.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>In like manner Vassar, Smith and Wellesley in the beginning
found it necessary to admit special students—students,
that is to say, interested in special subjects, but without
sufficient general training to be able to matriculate as college
students; but their admission has been recognized as
disadvantageous, and has gradually been restricted. In
1870 special students, as distinguished from preparatory
students, formed 19.6 per cent of the whole number of the
students of Vassar; in 1899 they formed only 3.9 per cent,
and only 3.3 per cent of the whole number of Wellesley
students. Smith since 1891 has declined to admit them
at all, and Bryn Mawr never admitted them.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Again, Wellesley and Vassar in the beginning organized
preparatory departments with pupils living in the same halls
as the college students and taught in great part by the same
teachers. The presence of these pupils tended to turn the
colleges into boarding schools, and the steady and rapid
development of Vassar as a true college began only after the
closing of its preparatory department in 1888; until this
time the number of students in the college proper had been
almost stationary; Wellesley closed its preparatory department
in 1880; Smith never organized one; Bryn Mawr
never organized one; Mt. Holyoke, the Woman’s college
of Baltimore, and Wells college have all closed their preparatory
departments within the last seven years.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>It seems to have been at first supposed that the same
standards of scholarship need not be applied in the choice
of instructors to teach women as in that of instructors to
teach men, that women were fittest to teach women, and that
the personal character and influence of the woman instructor
in some mysterious way supplied the deficiency on her part
of academic training. For a long time not even an ordinary
undergraduate education was required of her, and there are
still teaching in women’s colleges too many women without
even a first degree. But it has been found on the whole
that systematic mental training is best imparted by those
who have themselves received it; the numbers of well-trained
women are increasing; and the prejudice against
the appointment of men where men are better qualified has
almost disappeared.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>It has been recognized that the work done in women’s
colleges is most satisfactory to women when it is the same
in quality and quantity as the work done in colleges for men,
and it has been recognized also that they need the same
time for its performance. Domestic work, therefore, which
by the founder of Wellesley was regarded as a necessary
part of women’s education, is at present, I believe, required
nowhere except on the perfectly plain ground of economy.
The hour of domestic service originally required of every
student in Wellesley was abandoned in 1896; a half-hour is
still required at Mt. Holyoke, but tuition, board and residence
are less expensive there. The time given to domestic
work is obviously so much time taken from academic work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of discipline the tendency has been toward
ever-diminishing supervision by the college authorities.
Vassar and Wellesley began with the strict regulations of a
boarding school; it was regarded as impossible that young
women living away from home should be in any measure
trusted with the control of their own actions. Smith from
the first allowed more liberty, in part because many of her
students lived in boarding houses outside the college. In
all three colleges the restrictions laid upon the students
have been gradually lessened, and at Vassar there is at
present a well-developed system of what is known as “limited
self-government,” according to which many matters of
discipline are intrusted to the whole body of students.
Bryn Mawr was organized with a system of self-government
by the students perhaps more far-reaching than was then in
operation in any of the colleges for men; the necessary
rules are made by the Students’ association, which includes
all undergraduate and graduate students, and enforced by
an executive committee of students who in the case of a
serious offense may recommend the suspension or expulsion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of the offender, and whose recommendation, when sustained
by the whole association, is always accepted by the college.
The perfect success of the system has shown that there is no
risk in relying to the fullest extent on the discretion of a
body of women students.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>In the smaller group, which includes the College for women
of Western reserve university and the H. Sophie Newcomb
memorial college, the affiliated college tends to become an
entirely separate institution; in its instructors and instruction
it differs widely from the institution to which it is affiliated;
it is, in fact, a different college called into existence by
the same authorities. In the larger group, which includes the
Women’s college of Brown, Barnard and Radcliffe, the affiliated
college tends to blend itself with the institution to which
it is affiliated in a new coeducational institution. The ideal
in view is a complete identity of instructors and instruction
and the law of economy of force forbids attaining this ideal
by the duplication of the whole instruction given. It is less
wasteful to double the number of hearers in any lecture
room than to repeat the lecture. It is in the Women’s college
of Brown that we find the closest affiliation and,
accordingly, the nearest approach to coeducation. The
corporation of Brown furnished the land on which Pembroke
hall, the academic building of the Women’s college,
was erected, and accepted the gift of the building when
it was completed; Brown has from first to last openly
assumed responsibility for its affiliated college in fact as
well as name. In the graduate department of Brown there
is, as has been said, unrestricted coeducation; and in many
of the smaller undergraduate elective courses women are
reciting with men. In the graduate department of Columbia
there is now unrestricted coeducation. It is in the case of
Radcliffe that there is least approach to coeducation. What
has made possible the policy pursued at Radcliffe has been
the self-sacrificing zeal of many eminent Harvard professors,
willing at any cost of inconvenience to give to women what
could seemingly on no other terms be given; but the sacrifice
is too great, and in the modern world too unnecessary;
it is at present almost everywhere possible for the professor
interested in educating women to lighten his own labors by
admitting them to the same classes with men. Only the
affiliated colleges of the second group present in their internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>organization a type essentially different from that of the
independent college—a type intermediate between the independent
and the coeducational.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION</h3>

<p class='c006'><b>Graduate instruction in the faculty of philosophy</b>—True university
instruction begins after the completion of the college
course, and very little such instruction is given by any
American university<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> except in the so-called graduate schools
belonging to the twenty-three colleges in the United States
included in the Federation of graduate clubs.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> In the following
16 of these 23 graduate schools women are admitted
without restriction and compete with men for many of the
scholarships and honors: Yale, Brown, Cornell, Columbia,
New York university, Pennsylvania, Columbian, Vanderbilt,
Missouri, Western reserve, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, California, Leland Stanford Junior; Bryn Mawr
and Wellesley admit women only; Harvard admits them
to certain courses through the mediation of Radcliffe.
There remain, apart from the Catholic university, only 3
graduate schools excluding women: Clark, Princeton and
the Johns Hopkins university; and in the Johns Hopkins
they are admitted to at least one university department—that
of the medical school.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>In 1898–99 there were studying in these 23 graduate
schools 1,021 women, forming 26.8 per cent of the
whole number of graduate students.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a> In 1889–90 the U.
S. education report estimates that there were 271 women
graduate students out of a total of 2,041 graduate students,
or women formed 13.27 per cent of all graduate
students; in 1897–98 the report for that year estimates that
there were 1,398 women out of a total of 5,816 graduate
students, or women formed 24.04 per cent of all students—a
remarkable increase as compared to the increase of men
graduate students in 8 years.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Graduate fellowships and scholarships</b>—In 1899 there were
open to women 319 scholarships varying in value from $100
to $400 (50 of these exclusively for women) and 2 foreign

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r41'>41</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the sake of clearness I have omitted from the above table the 7 separate
medical schools for women, although I have counted their students in the total
number of women medical students, both in 1890 and 1898. In 1890 there were
studying in the 6 regular medical women’s colleges 425 women, as against 648
women in coeducational regular medical colleges; in 1898 there were studying
in them 411 women, as against 1045 in coeducational colleges, a decrease of
3.3 per cent, whereas women students in coeducational medical colleges have
increased 16.3 per cent. I limit the comparison to regular medical schools
because women have increased relatively more rapidly in irregular medical
schools and there is only one separate irregular medical school for women. It is
sometimes said that women prefer medical sects because the proportion of women
studying in irregular schools is relatively greater than the proportion studying in
regular schools; but in 1898, 85.7 per cent of the irregular schools were coeducational
and only 46.6 per cent of regular schools, a fact which undoubtedly increases
the proportion of students studying in irregular schools.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f42'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r42'>42</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The statistics for the schools of technology and agriculture are taken from the
U. S. education report for 1889–90, pp. 1053–1054, and from the report for 1897–98,
pp. 1985–1988. I have excluded schools of technology not endowed with the
national land grant. In 1890 there were 27 of such schools (5 of them coeducational);
in 1898 their number had fallen to 17 (3 of them coeducational). Very
few women are studying in these schools; in 1898 women formed only 0.2 per
cent of all students studying in them.</p>

there were very few women studying in any of these schools.
The wonderful increase both in facilities for professional
study and in the number of women students during the last
eight years may be seen by referring to the comparative
table on the opposite page.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident to the impartial observer that coeducation is to
be the method in professional schools. Except in medicine,
where women were at first excluded from coeducational study
by the strongest prejudice that has ever been conquered in any
movement, no important separate professional schools, indeed
none whatever, except one unimportant school of pharmacy
have been founded for women only.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a> It is evident also that
the number of women entering upon professional study is
increasing rapidly. If we compare the relative increase of
men and of women from 1890 to 1898 we obtain the following
percentages: increase of students in medicine, men,
51.1 per cent, women, 64.2 per cent; in dentistry, men, 150.2
per cent, women, 205.7 per cent; in pharmacy, men, 25.9 per
cent, women, 190 per cent; in technology and agriculture,
men, 119.3 per cent, women, 194.7 per cent.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p class='c008'>There are many questions connected with the college education
of American women which possess great interest
for the student of social science.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Number of college women</b>—In the year 1897–98<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a> there
were studying in the undergraduate and graduate departments
of coeducational colleges and universities 17,338
women, and in the undergraduate and graduate departments
of independent and affiliated women’s colleges, division
A, 4,959 women, women forming thus 27.4 per cent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the total number of graduate and undergraduate students.
The 22 colleges belonging to the Association of collegiate
alumnæ, which are, on the whole, the most important colleges
in the United States admitting women, have conferred the
bachelor’s degree on 12,804 women. If we add to these
the graduates of the Women’s college of Brown university,
102 in number, and the graduates of the 14 additional
coeducational colleges included in my list of the 58 most
important colleges in the United States, we obtain, including
those graduating in June, 1899, a total of 14,824 women
holding the bachelor’s degree.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a> There is thus formed, even
leaving out of account the graduates of the minor colleges,
a larger body of educated women than is to be found in
any other country in the world. These graduates have
received the most strenuous college training obtainable by
women in the United States, which does not differ materially
from the best college training obtainable by American men
(indeed, women graduates of coeducational colleges have
received precisely the same training as men), and may fairly
be compared with the women who have received college and
university training abroad. In other countries women university
graduates, or even women who have studied at
universities, are very few;<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a> in America, on the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the higher education of women has assumed the proportions
of a national movement still in progress. We may perhaps
be able to guide in some degree its future development, but
it has passed the experimental stage and can no longer be
opposed with any hope of success. Its results are to be
reckoned with as facts.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>Health of college women</b><a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c009'><sup>[47]</sup></a>—Those who have come into contact
with some of the many thousands of healthy normal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>women studying in college at the present time, or who have
had an opportunity to know something of the after-lives of
even a small number of college women, believe that experience
has proved them to be, both in college, and after leaving
college, on the whole, in better physical condition than
other women of the same age and social condition. Since,
however, people who have not the opportunity of knowledge
at first hand continue to regard the health of college women
as a subject open for discussion, a new health investigation,
based on questions sent to the 12,804 graduates of the 22
colleges belonging to the Association of collegiate alumnæ, is
now in progress. The statistical tables will be collated a
second time by the Massachusetts bureau of statistics of
labor and sent to the Paris exposition as part of the educational
exhibit of the Association of collegiate alumnæ.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c009'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><b>Marriage rate of college women</b>—Here again no positive
conclusions can be reached until we know what is the usual
marriage rate of women belonging to the social class of
women graduates. Everything indicates that the time of
marriage is becoming later in the professional classes and
that the marriage rate as a whole is decreasing. An investigation
undertaken simultaneously with the new health
investigation by the Association of collegiate alumnæ will
enable us to speak with certainty in regard to the marriage
rate of a large number of college women and their sisters.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
It must be borne in mind that the element of time is
very important, and in the case of women the later and
therefore younger classes are all larger than the earlier
ones, see table on opposite page.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that independent, affiliated and coeducational colleges fall
into their proper place in the series, thus showing conclusively that the method
of obtaining a college education exercises scarcely any appreciable influence on
the marriage rate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The marriage rate of Bryn Mawr college, calculated in January, 1900, will also
serve as an illustration of the importance of time in every consideration of the
marriage rate: graduates of the class of 1889, married, 40.7 per cent; graduates of
the first two classes, 1889–1890, married, 40.0 per cent; graduates of the first three
classes, 1889–1891, married, 33.3 per cent; graduates of the first four classes, 1889–1892,
married, 32.9 per cent; graduates of the first five classes, 1889–1893, married,
31.0 per cent; graduates of the first six classes, 1889–1894, married, 30.0 per cent;
graduates of the first seven classes, 1889–1895, married, 25.2 per cent; graduates
of the first eight classes, 1889–1896, married, 22.8 per cent; graduates of the first
nine classes, 1889–1897, married, 20.9 per cent; graduates of the first ten classes,
1889–1898, married, 17.2 per cent; graduates of the first eleven classes, 1889–1899,
married, 15.2 per cent.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><b>Occupations of college women</b>—It is probable that about
50 per cent of women graduates teach for at least a certain
number of years. Of the 705 women graduates whose
occupations were reported in the Association of collegiate
alumnæ investigation of 1883 50.2 percent were then teaching.
In 1895 of 1,082 graduates of Vassar 37.7 per cent
were teaching; 2.0 per cent were engaged in graduate study
and 3.0 per cent were physicians or studying medicine. In
1898 of 171 graduates (all living) of Radcliffe college, including
the class of 1898, 49.7 per cent were teaching; 8.7 per
cent were engaged in graduate study; .6 per cent were
studying medicine; 17.5 per cent were unmarried and without
professional occupation. In 1899 of 316 living graduates
of Bryn Mawr college, including the class of 1899, 39.0
percent were teaching; 11.4 were engaged in graduate
study; 6 per cent were engaged in executive work (including
4 deans of colleges, 3 mistresses of college halls of
residence); 1.6 per cent were studying or practising medicine,
and 26.6 per cent were unmarried and without professional
occupation.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><b>Coeducation vs. separate education</b>—It is clear that coeducation
is the prevailing method in the United States; it is
the most economical method; indeed it is the only possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>method in most parts of the country. Now that it has been
determined in America to send girls as well as boys to college,
it becomes impossible to duplicate colleges for women in every
part of this vast country. If, as is shown by the statistics
given in the successive reports of the commissioner of education,
men students in college are increasing faster far than
the ratio of the population, and women college students
are increasing faster still than men,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a> it will tax all our
resources to make adequate provision for men and women
in common. Only in thickly-settled parts of the country,
where public sentiment is conservative enough to justify the
initial outlay, have separate colleges for women been established,
and these colleges, without exception, have been
private foundations. Public opinion in the United States
almost universally demands that universities supported by
public taxation should provide for the college education of
the women of the state in which they are situated. The
separate colleges for women speaking generally are to be
found almost exclusively in the narrow strip of colonial states
lying along the Atlantic seaboard. The question is often
asked, whether women prefer coeducation or separate education.
It seems that in the east they as yet prefer separate
education, and this preference is natural.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> College life as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>it is organized in a woman’s college seems to conservative
parents less exposed, more in accordance with inherited traditions.
Consequently, girls who in their own homes lead
guarded lives, are to be found rather in women’s colleges
than in coeducational colleges. From the point of view of
conservative parents, there is undoubtedly serious objection
to intimate association at the most impressionable period of
a girl’s life with many young men from all parts of the country
and of every possible social class. From every point of view
it is undesirable to have the problems of love and marriage
presented for decision to a young girl during the four years
when she ought to devote her energies to profiting by the
only systematic intellectual training she is likely to receive
during her life. Then, too, for the present, much of the culture
and many of the priceless associations of college life are
to be obtained, whether for men or women, only by residence
in college halls, and no coeducational, or even affiliated, colleges
have as yet organized for their students such a complete
college life as the independent woman’s college. So
long as this preference, and the grounds for it, exist, we must
see to it that separate colleges for women are no less good
than colleges for men. In professional schools, including the
graduate school of the faculty of philosophy, coeducation is
even at present almost the only method. There are in the
United States only 4 true graduate schools for men closed
to women, and only 1 independent graduate school maintained
for women offering three years’ consecutive work
leading to the degree of Ph. D. There is every reason to
believe that as soon as large numbers of women wish to
enter upon the study of theology, law and medicine, all the
professional schools now existing will become coeducational.</p>

<p class='c006'><b>A modified vs. an unmodified curriculum</b>—The progress of
women’s education, as we have traced it briefly from its
beginning in the coeducational college of Oberlin in 1833,
and the independent woman’s college of Vassar in 1865, has
been a progress in accordance with the best academic traditions
of men’s education. In 1870 we could not have predicted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the course to be taken by the higher education of
women; the separate colleges for women might have developed
into something wholly different from what we had been
familiar with so long in the separate colleges for men. A
female course in coeducational colleges in which music and
art were substituted for mathematics and Greek might have
met the needs of the women students. After thirty years
of experience, however, we are prepared to say that whatever
changes may be made in future in the college curriculum
will be made for men and women alike. After all, women
themselves must be permitted to be the judges of what kind
of intellectual discipline they find most truly serviceable.
They seem to have made up their minds, and hereafter may
be trusted to see to it that an inferior education shall not
be offered to them in women’s colleges, or elsewhere, under
the name of a modified curriculum.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That their admission was due in large part to the stress of circumstances is
shown by the fact that in the very states in which these coeducational schools
had been established there was manifested on other occasions a most illiberal
attitude toward girls’ education. In the few cities of the Atlantic seaboard,
where European conservatism was too strong to allow girls to be taught
with boys in the new high schools, and where there were boys enough to fill the
schools, girls had to wait much longer before their needs were provided
for at all, and then most inadequately. In Boston, where the boys’ and girls’
high schools were separated, it was impossible until 1878 for a Boston girl to be
prepared for college in a city high school, whereas, in the country towns of Massachusetts,
where boys and girls were taught together in the high schools, the girl
had had the same opportunities as the boy for twenty-five or thirty years. Indeed,
it was not until 1852 that Boston girls obtained, and then only in connection with
the normal school, a public high-school education of any kind whatsoever. In
Philadelphia, where boys and girls are taught separately in the high schools, no
girl could be prepared for college before 1893, neither Latin, French, nor German
being taught in the girls’ high school, whereas, for many years the boys’ high school
had prepared boys for college. In Baltimore the two girls’ high schools are still,
in 1900, unable to prepare girls for college, whereas the boys’ high school has for
years prepared boys to enter the Johns Hopkins university. The impossibility of
preparing girls for college is only another way of stating that the instruction
given is very imperfect.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The magnitude of this fact will be apparent if we reflect that here for the first
time the girls of a great nation, especially of the poorer classes, have from their
earliest infancy to the age of eighteen or nineteen received the same education as
the boys, and that the ladder leading, in Huxley’s words, from the gutter to the
university may be climbed as easily by a girl as by a boy. Although college education
has affected as yet only a very few out of the great number of adult women
in the United States, the free opportunities for secondary education have influenced
the whole American people for nearly two-thirds of a century. The men of the
poorer classes have had, as a rule, mothers as well educated as their fathers,
indeed, better educated; to this, more than to any other single cause, I think,
may be attributed what by other nations is regarded as the phenomenal industrial
progress of the United States. Our commercial rivals could probably take
no one step that would so tend to place them on a level with American competition
as to open to girls without distinction all their elementary and secondary
schools for boys. In 1892, girls formed 55.9 per cent, and in 1898, 56.5 per cent of
all pupils in the public and private secondary schools of the United States.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1870 women formed 59.0 per cent; in 1880, 57.2 per cent; in 1890, 65.5 per
cent; and in 1898, 67.8 per cent (in the North Atlantic Division 80.8 per cent) of
all teachers in the public elementary and secondary schools of the United States
(U. S. ed. rep. for 1897–98, pp. xiii, lxxv). It has been frequently remarked that
the feminine pronouns “she” and “her” are instinctively used in America in
common speech with reference to a teacher. Moreover more women than men
are teaching in the public and private secondary schools of the United States (in
1898, women formed 53.8 per cent of the total number of secondary teachers, see
U. S. ed. rep. for 1897–98, pp. 2053, 2069); whereas in all other countries the secondary
teaching of boys is wholly in the hands of men.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In many cases in the west women made their way into the universities through
the normal department of the university, being admitted to that first of all. The
summer schools of western colleges, chiefly attended by teachers, among whom
women were in the majority, served also as an entering wedge. (See Woman’s
work in America, Holt &amp; Co., 1891, pp. 71–75.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Antioch college opened, however, with only 8 students in its college department,
all the rest, 142, belonging to its secondary school.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r6'>6</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In every case I give the date when full coeducation was introduced; West Virginia,
for example, admitted women to limited privileges in 1889.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In discussing coeducation I shall, therefore, disregard the divisions into north
Atlantic, south Atlantic, north central, south central and western, employed by
the U. S. census and the U. S. bureau of education. The New England, middle
and southern states are all, of course, eastern, and, with the exception of Vermont,
West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri, are all seaboard states,
Pennsylvania being counted as a seaboard state on account of its close river connection
with the sea. It will be noted that the inland southern states are rather
western than eastern in their characteristics. The northern middle states belong
on the whole by their sympathies to New England, the southern middle to the
southern states. Missouri, having been a slave state and settled largely by
southerners, is still southern in feeling. The District of Columbia also may conveniently
be counted with the southern states.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two of the three next largest colleges in Virginia—Richmond and Roanoke—admit
women, but the advance in women’s education in that state has been very
recent. Until the establishment of the State normal school in 1883 there was not
a scientific laboratory in the state accessible to women; in 1893 the Randolph-Macon
Woman’s college opened with several laboratories, see Prof. Celestia
Parrish, Proceedings 2d Capon Springs conference for education in the south,
1899, p. 68. I am much indebted to the author of this paper for valuable data
in regard to coeducation in the south.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Massachusetts institute of technology is classified by the U. S. ed. reps.
among technical schools.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The commissioner of education does not feel himself at liberty to discriminate
among the colleges chartered by the different states, but it is well known that in
most states the name of college, or preferably that of university, and the power
to confer degrees are granted to any institution whatsoever without regard to
endowment, scientific equipment, scholarly qualifications of the faculty or adequate
preparation of the students. The majority of the so-called colleges and
universities of the south and west are really secondary schools. In most of them
not only are the greater part of the students really pupils in the preparatory or
high school department, but most of the students in the collegiate departments
are at graduation barely able to enter upon the sophomore or second year work of
the best eastern colleges. Throughout this monograph I have used the word college
in speaking of institutions for undergraduate education, except when quoting
their official titles, and this whether the college in question is, or is not, included
in a larger institution providing also three years of graduate instruction. The
terms college and university are used in America without any definite understanding,
even among colleges and universities themselves, as to how they shall be
differentiated. Probably the most commonly accepted usage is to call an institution
a university if it has attached to it various departments, or schools, without
regard to the standing of these departments, the preparation of the students entering
them, or the work done in them. In this sense all the state universities of the
west are called universities because, although many of them are really high
schools, they have attached to them schools of pharmacy, veterinary science,
agriculture, and sometimes medicine or law. It is in this sense that many institutions
for negroes are called universities, because they include various departments
of industrial art as well as a high school department. Until very recently
the requirements for admission to the departments of law, medicine, dentistry,
etc., have been so low that it has been a positive disadvantage to have such schools
attached to the college department, and when lately the graduates of Harvard college
decided not to allow the graduates of its affiliated schools to vote with them
for representatives on the board of trustees, they claimed with justice that the
illiberal education of the majority of these graduates would tend to lower the
standard of Harvard college. The use of the word university should be strictly
limited to institutions offering at least three years of graduate instruction in one
or more schools.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this list of fifty-eight colleges I have included: first, the twenty-four colleges
(indicated in the list by “a”) whose graduates are admitted to the Association
of collegiate alumnæ; second, the twenty-three colleges (24 are included in
the Federation, but Barnard has ceased to be a graduate school, see page <a href='#Page_28'>28</a>)
included in the Federation of graduate clubs (indicated by “b”); third, the fifty-two
colleges (indicated by “c”) included in the 1899–1900 edition of Minerva, the
well-known handbook of colleges and universities of the world published each
year by Truebner &amp; Co.; and fourth, the colleges which, according to the U. S.
education report for 1897–98, have at least $500,000 worth of productive funds
(indicated by “d”), and also three hundred or more students (indicated by “e”).
In the case of state universities the money they receive annually from national and
state appropriations may reasonably be regarded as a sort of supplementary
endowment; I have, therefore, included the state universities of Maine, Iowa and
West Virginia, whose productive funds do not amount to $500,000. This list of
fifty-eight colleges, arranged according to the different sections of the country,
and as far as possible in the order of the numbers in their undergraduate departments,
is as follows: <i>New England and 3 northern middle states</i>: Harvard (bcde),
Yale (bcde), Cornell (abcde-coed.), Massachusetts institute of technology (acde-coed.),
Smith (acde-woman’s college), Princeton (bcde), Pennsylvania (bcde), Columbia
(bcde), Brown (bcde), Wellesley (abce-woman’s college), Vassar (acde-woman’s
college), Syracuse (acde-coed.), Dartmouth (cde), Boston (acde-coed.), Amherst
(cde), Radcliffe (abce-affiliated), Williams (cde), Lehigh (cde), Maine (e-coed.),
Wesleyan (acde-coed.), Vermont (c-coed.), Lafayette (c), Bryn Mawr (abed-woman’s
college), New York University (cd), Barnard (a-affiliated), Hamilton (c),
Colgate (cd), Clark (bcd-no undergrad. department). <i>Southern and 2 southern middle
states</i>: Missouri (bcde-coed.), Texas (cde-coed.), Columbian (bce-coed.), West Virginia
(e-coed.), Tulane (cd), Vanderbilt (bcd-coed.), Virginia (c), Johns Hopkins
(bcd), Washington (St. Louis) (cd-coed.), Georgetown (c-Catholic), Catholic university
(cd-no undergrad. department). <i>Western states</i>: Minnesota (abcde-coed.),
Michigan (abcde-coed.), California (abcde-coed.), Wisconsin (abcde-coed.), Chicago
(abcde-coed.), Leland Stanford (abcde-coed.), Nebraska (ace-coed.), Ohio state
university (de-coed.), Indiana (cde-coed.), Illinois (ce-coed.), Kansas (ace-coed.),
Ohio Wesleyan (cde-coed.), Iowa (e-coed.), Northwestern (acde-coed.), Oberlin
(acde-coed.), Cincinnati (cd-coed.), Colorado (c-coed.), Western reserve (bcd),
College for Women of western reserve (a-affiliated).</p>

<p class='c000'>The only attempt hitherto made in America to discriminate between colleges
of true college grade and others has been made by the Association of collegiate
alumnæ. This association was organized in 1882 for the purpose of uniting women
graduates of the foremost coeducational colleges and colleges for women only into
an association for work connected with the higher education of women. In the
early years of the association there was appointed a committee on admissions, and
the admission of each successive college in the association has been carefully considered,
both with regard to its entrance requirements, the training of its faculty
and its curriculum. The Association of collegiate alumnæ concerns itself, of
course, only with colleges admitting women, but there is no doubt that the
fifteen coeducational colleges and seven colleges for women only admitted to
the association would, in the estimation of every one familiar with the subject,
rank among the first fifty-eight colleges of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Federation of graduate clubs is an association of graduate students of
those colleges whose graduate schools are important enough to entitle them to
admission to the federation. The colleges in the Federation of graduate clubs
are the only colleges in the United States that do true university work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In only two instances, so far as I know, has coeducation once introduced been
abandoned or restricted in any way. The private college of Adelbert of Western
reserve, coeducational from 1873, opened a separate woman’s college and excluded
women in 1888. As the college department was very small and the state of Ohio
in which the college was situated the most eastern in feeling of all western states,
the change was seemingly to be attributed to a bid for students through undergraduate
novelty. The Baptist college of Colby, in Maine, coeducational from
1871, has taught women in separate classes in required work since 1890. Women
are not allowed to compete with men for college prizes or for membership in the
students’ society, which elects its members on account of scholarship. Complete
separation, which was at first planned, has proved impracticable and from the
beginning of the sophomore year women and men recite<a id='t13'></a> together in all elective
work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r13'>13</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an investigation made several years ago in the University of Wisconsin,
which has been open to women since 1874, it was found that the women ranked in
scholarship very considerably beyond the men. In the University of Michigan,
where women have been educated with men since 1870, President Angell has
repeatedly laid stress on their excellent scholarship. When in 1893–94 a committee
of the faculty of the University of Virginia asked the officers of a large number of
coeducational colleges especially in regard to this point the testimony received
was very remarkable. In England it should be noted that the question of the
success of women in collegiate studies has been put beyond a doubt by the published
class lists of the competitive honor examinations of Oxford and Cambridge.
In the discussions in regard to granting women degrees at Cambridge, it was
freely admitted that women’s minds were “splendid for examination purposes.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r14'>14</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a discussion of coeducation in schools and colleges in 1892, see U. S. education

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r15'>15</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>U. S. education report 1889–90, pp. 761, 1582–1599, and 1897–98, p. 1823; account
is taken of students of true college grade only in the college proper. Throughout
this monograph I have corrected the figures of the U. S. ed. reps. which are
affected by the erroneous assumption that the undergraduate departments of
Brown, Yale, Rochester, New York Univ., Pennsylvania, Tulane and Western
Reserve are coeducational. In the University of Chicago women formed, in
1898, 54.5 per cent of all regular, and 70 per cent of all unclassified, students;
in Boston university in the regular college course there were, in 1899, 299 women
as against 192 men.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r16'>16</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1889–90 there were 19,245 men studying in 146 colleges for men only; in
1898–99 there were 25,915 men studying in 143 colleges for men only, an increase
of only 34.7 per cent. (In enumerating students I have regarded the limited
coeducational college of Colby as coeducational.) Women, however, have
increased in women’s colleges 138.4 per cent.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r17'>17</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The objection of men students in the east to coeducation seems to be mainly
in the apprehension that the presence of women may interfere with the free social
life which has become so prominent a feature of private colleges for men in the
east. These colleges are, for the most part, situated either in small country towns,
or in the suburbs of a city, in communities which have grown up about the college,
and their students live largely in college dormitories; the conditions, therefore,
are exceedingly unlike those prevailing in non-residential colleges and also unlike
those prevailing in the world at large. These exceptional conditions are a source
of pleasure and, in many respects, of advantage to the student. Undoubtedly
there is in coeducational colleges less unrestraint; young men undoubtedly care
much for the impression that they make on young women of the same age, and
there is more decorum and perhaps more diligence in classrooms where women
are present. The objection to coeducation on the part of women students is, to
some extent, the same; separate colleges for women in like manner are, as a rule,
academic communities living according to regulations and customs all their own;
women also feel themselves more unrestrained when they are studying in women’s
colleges. Then, too, coeducation in the east is still regarded as in some
measure an experiment, to the success of which the conduct of each individual
woman may, or may not, contribute, and the knowledge of this tends to
increase the self-consciousness of student life.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r18'>18</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the case of the colleges in groups I and II these statistics have been
obtained through the kindness of the presidents of the colleges concerned;
they are for the year 1900, except the numbers of instructors and students which
are obtained from the catalogues for the year 1898–99; in enumerating the
instructors, presidents, teachers of gymnastics, elocution, music and art have
been omitted. Instructors away on leave of absence are not counted among
instructors for the current year.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r19'>19</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Women’s colleges were first classified in division A and division B in 1887.
In these reports there appeared sporadically in division A Ingham university,
at Leroy, New York, and Rutgers female college in New York city. Neither
of these had any adequate endowment and neither ever obtained more
than 35 students. Ingham university closed in 1893, Rutgers female college in
1895.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r20'>20</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The women’s colleges, so called, included in division B of these reports, are in
reality church and private enterprise schools, as a rule of the most superficial
character, without endowment, or fixed curriculum, or any standard whatsoever of
scholarship in teachers or pupils. What money there is to spend is for the most
part used to provide teachers of music, drawing and other accomplishments, and
the school instruction proper is shamefully inadequate. Few if any of these
schools are able to teach the subjects required for entrance to a college properly
so called; the really good girls’ schools are, as a rule, excluded from this list by
their honesty in not assuming the name of college. The U. S. education report
for 1886–87 gives 152 of these colleges in division B, the report for 1897–98, 135.
When it is said that separate colleges for women are decreasing, the statement is
based on this list of colleges in division B, which are not really colleges at all;
and when it is said that women students are not increasing so rapidly in separate
colleges for women as in coeducational colleges, it is the students in these miscalled
colleges who are referred to; for precisely the reverse is true of students
in genuine colleges for women. It is happily true that since better college education
has been obtainable, women have been refusing to attend the institutions
included in class B. Between 1890 and 1898 women have increased only 4.9 per
cent in the college departments of such institutions, whereas, in these same eight
years, they have increased 138.4 per cent in women’s colleges in division A. The
value of statistics of women college students is often vitiated by the fact that
women studying in institutions included in division B are counted among college
students. Many of the colleges for men only and of the coeducational colleges
included in the lists of the commissioner of education are very low in grade, but
few of them are so scandalously inefficient as the majority of the girls’ schools
included in division B. I have, therefore, in my statistics taken no account
whatever of women studying in institutions classified in division B.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r21'>21</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See pp. 1821, 1822, 1888, 1889. Bryn Mawr had not 300 undergraduate students
in 1897–98, but the next year, 1898–99, passed the limit. I have excluded Western
reserve as it is not coeducational in its undergraduate department, and, in 1899,
had only 182 men in its men’s college and 183 women in its women’s college.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c024' id='f22'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r22'>22</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To any one familiar with the circumstances it does not admit of discussion that
in Vassar we have the legitimate parent of all future colleges for women which
were to be founded in such rapid succession in the next period. It is true that in
1855 the Presbyterian synod opened Elmira college in Elmira, New York, but it
had practically no endowment and scarcely any college students. Even before
1855 two famous female seminaries were founded which did much to create a
standard for the education of girls. In 1821 Mrs. Emma Willard opened at Troy
a seminary for girls, known as the Troy female seminary, still existing under the
name of the Emma Willard school. In 1837 Mary Lyon opened in the beautiful
valley of the Connecticut Mt. Holyoke seminary, where girls were educated so
cheaply that it was almost a free school. This institution has had a great
influence in the higher education of women; it became in 1893 Mt. Holyoke
college. These seminaries are often claimed as the first women’s colleges, but
their curriculum of study proves conclusively that they had no thought whatever
of giving women a collegiate education, whereas, the deliberations of the board
of trustees whom Mr. Vassar associated with himself show clearly that it
was expressly realized that here for the first time was being created a
woman’s college as distinct from the seminary or academy. In 1861 the movement
for the higher education of women had scarcely begun. It was not until
eight years later that the first of the women’s colleges at Cambridge, England,
opened.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c024' id='f23'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r23'>23</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The founder of Wellesley expected to leave the college a large endowment, but
his fortune was dissipated in unfortunate investments. The splendid grounds
and many halls of residence of the college constitute a form of endowment, otherwise
its lack of productive funds would have excluded it from class I.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c024' id='f24'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r24'>24</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The numbers of students are for the year 1899–1900.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r25'>25</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To the women’s colleges of group III they are admitted still in large numbers,
and they still form 35.1 per cent of all the undergraduate students in the affiliated
college of Radcliffe, and 35.7 per cent of all the undergraduate students in the
affiliated college of Barnard; in part, perhaps, because these colleges are largely
dependent upon their tuition fees, and in part too, no doubt, because the
presence of special students is less disadvantageous where there is no dormitory
life.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r26'>26</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Colleges for women draw their students from private schools to a much greater
extent than do coeducational colleges; and it was the very great inefficiency of these
schools that induced the earlier colleges for women to organize preparatory
departments of their own. The entrance examinations of the women’s colleges
are the only influence for good that has ever been brought to bear upon the
feeble teaching of these schools. In 1874, before the numbers of women wishing
to prepare for college were great enough to influence the private schools,
a plan for raising their standard was devised by the Woman’s education
association of Boston, at whose request Harvard university for 7 years conducted
a series of examinations modeled on the Oxford and Cambridge higher
local examinations which have been such an efficient agency in England. Committees
of women were organized in different cities, and an attempt was made
to induce girls’ schools to send up candidates for these examinations. In 7 years,
however, only 106 candidates offered themselves for the preliminary examination,
and only 36 received a complete certificate. In 1881 the entrance examinations
of Harvard college were substituted for these special women’s examinations, in
the hope that the interest in reaching the standard set by Harvard for its entering
class of men might add to the number of candidates; but even after this change
was made comparatively few candidates took the examinations, and in 1896 the
effort was discontinued; the Harvard examinations have been used from that
time onward simply as the ordinary entrance examinations of Radcliffe college.
In Great Britain the Cambridge higher local examinations are taken annually by
about 900 women. There was needed some such pressure as is brought to bear
by pupils determined to go to college to induce private schools to add college
graduates to their staff of teachers. The requirements for admission to Bryn
Mawr college have to my personal knowledge been a most important factor in
introducing college-bred women as teachers into all the more important private
girls’ schools of Philadelphia and in many private schools elsewhere; and every
college for women drawing students from private schools has the same experience.
On the other hand, every relaxation in the requirements for admission,
such as the practice of admitting on certificate adopted by Vassar, Wellesley
and Smith, tends to deprive girls’ schools of a much needed stimulus. Radcliffe
and Barnard, like Bryn Mawr, insist upon examination for admission and decline
to accept certificates.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r27'>27</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Until Bryn Mawr opened in 1885 with a large staff of young unmarried men,
it had been regarded as almost out of the question to appoint unmarried men in
a women’s college; now they are teaching in all colleges for women. The same
instructors pass from colleges for men to colleges for women and from colleges
for women to colleges for men, employing in each the same methods of instruction.
Some years since one of the professors at Smith college received at the
same time offers of a post at the Johns Hopkins, at Columbia, and at Bryn Mawr;
and among the professors the most successful in their teaching at Princeton, Chicago
and Columbia are men whose whole experience had been gained in teaching
women at Bryn Mawr.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r28'>28</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The following data have been furnished me by the courtesy of the presidents
or deans of the colleges concerned, except the data of the H. Sophie Newcomb
memorial college, for which I am indebted to Professor Evelyn Ordway. These
data are for the year 1900; the numbers of instructors and students have been
obtained from the catalogues for 1898–99.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r29'>29</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In one instance only—that of Evelyn college in New Jersey—has an affiliated
college, once established, been compelled to close its doors. Evelyn, however,
partook of the nature of a private enterprise school, and was begun on an unacademic
basis in 1887. A certain number of Princeton professors consented to
serve on the board of trustees and give instruction there, but it was, in reality, a
young ladies’ finishing school with a few students (in 1891, 22; in 1894, 18; in
1897, 14) pursuing collegiate courses. Music and accomplishments were made
much of, and in 1897 the college came to a well-merited end.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r30'>30</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Radcliffe and Barnard are the only two of the affiliated colleges that appear in
the U. S. education reports in division A of women’s colleges. The students of
the other three are reported under Brown, Western reserve and Tulane respectively,
thus giving these colleges a false air of being coeducational in their undergraduate
departments. The endowment and equipment of these three affiliated
colleges, although entirely independent of the colleges to which they are affiliated,
are given nowhere separately.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r31'>31</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is difficult for those interested in women’s education in England to understand
the existence in America of independent colleges for women, and if American
education were organized like English education they would, indeed, have no
reason to exist. In an English university, consisting, as it does, of many separate
colleges whose students live in their separate halls of residence, are taught
by their own teachers, hear in common with the students of other colleges
the lectures offered by the central university organization, and compete against
each other in honor examinations conducted by a common board of university
examiners, the colleges for women—at Cambridge, Girton and Newnham,
and at Oxford, Somerville hall, Lady Margaret hall and St. Hugh’s hall—are
organized in precisely the same way as colleges for men. They may,
or may not, be as well equipped as the best men’s colleges, but the difference is a
matter of endowment, not of university organization; there are differences also
between the various colleges for men. Examinations, again, play a far more
important part in English than in American education. There are in Great Britain
only a few examining and degree-giving bodies, for whose examinations all
the various colleges prepare their students. The degrees mean that certain
examinations have been passed, and have a definite and universally acknowledged
value. A degree given by an American college means that the person receiving
it has lived for some time in a community of a certain kind, enjoying certain
opportunities of which he has conscientiously availed himself. For this reason
no one of the 491 colleges of the United States enumerated in the U. S. education
report for 1897–98 bestows its degree in recognition of examinations passed in
any other college. For this reason Harvard college has had logic on its side in
declining to confer upon the students completing their undergraduate course in
Radcliffe college the Harvard B. A. They have not lived in the same community,
nor yet had all the opportunities of the Harvard student. The certificate received
by the student of Girton or Newnham represents exactly the same thing as the
Cambridge degree; the B. A. of Radcliffe does not represent the same thing as the
Harvard B. A. What is represented by the degrees of different colleges in the
United States may, or may not, be equal, but never is the same. Nevertheless
Columbia, Brown, Tulane and Western reserve confer their degrees upon the
women graduates of their affiliated colleges for women.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first American affiliated college was the so-called Harvard annex, which
was brought into existence by the devoted efforts of a small number of influential
professors of Harvard college, who voluntarily formed themselves into a
“Society for the collegiate instruction of women,” and repeated each week to
classes of women the lectures and class work they gave to men in Harvard
college. The idea first occurred to Mr. Arthur Gilman in 1878. Girton college,
Cambridge, England, after which the annex was modeled, had then been in successful
operation for nine years. Mrs. Louis Agassiz, the widow of the famous
naturalist, agreed to become the official head of the undertaking, and she associated
with herself other influential Boston and Cambridge women. Mr. Arthur
Gilman became the secretary of the society. The president of Harvard college
declared that, so far as the university was concerned, the professors were free
to teach women in their leisure hours if they chose. The annex was opened
for students in 1879 in a rented house near the Harvard campus with 25
students.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The medical school of the Johns Hopkins university is a true university school,
admitting only holders of the bachelor’s degree; the law school of Harvard university
is practically a university school, although seniors in Harvard college are
received as students.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r34'>34</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Out of the 58 most important American colleges enumerated on page <a href='#Page_12'>12</a> only
23, it will be remembered, appear in the lists of the Federation of graduate clubs.
Unfortunately it must not be inferred that all these 23 colleges are doing true
professional work and offering graduate students a three years’ course leading to
the degree of Ph. D. In some of them there are provided only courses leading to
the degree of A. M., which, like the degree of A. B., indicating general culture.
The affiliated college of Radcliffe appears in the list of graduate clubs, although
it can scarcely be said to exist independently as a separate graduate school, being
virtually the portal by which women are admitted to a limited amount of graduate
work at Harvard. In 1899–1900 only 12 graduate lecture courses and 3 research
courses were repeated at Radcliffe.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The graduate courses of Clark (which has no undergraduate department) are
few in number and attended by only 48 men; the exclusion of women is, therefore,
very surprising especially as the principal subjects of instruction, pedagogy,
experimental psychology and the like, are of peculiar interest to women. The
exclusion of women from all but the medical department of the Johns Hopkins
university is really of serious import, because the Johns Hopkins university, judged
not by numbers but by scholarly research and publication, the number of Ph. D.
degrees conferred, and the important college and university positions filled by its
graduates, has long been, and perhaps is still, the most important graduate school
in the United States. Its attitude toward women is to be accounted for in part
by its location, and in part by the fact that its management is in the hands of a
self-perpetuating board of twelve trustees appointed originally by the founder,
and without exception Baltimoreans, so that no pressure can be brought to bear
upon the corporation from more progressive sections of the country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These figures are taken from the Graduate handbook for 1899, published by the
Federation of graduate clubs. Of these the greatest number studying in any one
institution in the west was to be found in the University of Chicago, and the next
greatest in the University of California; the greatest number studying in any one
institution in the east was to be found at Barnard-Columbia, and the next greatest
at Bryn Mawr. There were studying in the graduate departments of the University
of Chicago (including summer students) 276 women; in the University of
California, 90; in Barnard-Columbia, 82; in Bryn Mawr, 61; in Radcliffe-Harvard,
58; in Yale, 42; in Cornell, 36; in the University of Pennsylvania, 34. The position
of Bryn Mawr in this series seems to show conclusively that an independent
woman’s college maintaining a sufficiently high standard of instruction may
compete successfully for students with much larger and older coeducational
foundations.</p>

courtesy of the presidents of the colleges concerned. In some cases the women
graduates have had to be selected from the total number of graduates and
counted separately for the purpose. As the figures have never been printed
before, I give them below: <i>22 colleges belonging to the Association of collegiate alumnæ</i>:—coeducational
colleges: Boston, 522 graduates; California, 440; Chicago, 267; Cornell,

women graduates.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The number of women studying in universities in Germany in 1898–99 was
approximately 471, probably mainly foreigners (statistics given in the Hochschul
Nachrichten, Minerva, etc.); in France in 1896–97, approximately 410, of whom 83
were foreigners (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Universités françaises</span>, by M. Louis Liard; vol. 2 of Special
Reports on Educational Subjects, Education department, London, 1898); in
England and Wales in 1897–98, approximately 2,348. (See catalogues of different
colleges.) The total number of women graduates in England and Wales who have
received degrees, or their equivalent, from English and Welsh universities is
about 2,180.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f47'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r47'>47</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two statistical investigations of the health of college women have been undertaken;
one in America in 1882, which tabulated various data connected with the
health, occupation, marriage, birth rate, etc., of 705 graduates of the 12 American
colleges belonging at that time to the Association of collegiate alumnæ (Health
statistics of women college graduates; report of a special committee of the Association
of collegiate alumnæ, Annie G. Howes, chairman; together with statistical
tables collated by the Massachusetts bureau of statistics of labor. Boston: Wright
and Potter Printing Co., 18 Post Office Square. 1885), and one in England in
1887 (Health statistics of women students of Cambridge and Oxford and of their
sisters, by Mrs. Henry Sidgwick, Cambridge university press, 1890). The English
statistics dealt with 566 women students (honor students who had taken tripos
examinations and final honors, and women who had been in residence three, two
and one year) of Newnham and Girton colleges, Cambridge, and of Lady Margaret
and Somerville halls at Oxford. It was found that in England 75 per cent of the
honor students were at the time of the investigation in excellent or good health.
It was found that in America 78 per cent of the graduates were at the time of the
investigation in good health and 5 per cent in fair health. In estimating the
result of this investigation it is difficult to find a standard of comparison. There
is no way of knowing what percentage of good health is to be expected in the
case of the average woman who has not been to college. It is stated in the American
health investigation, page <a href='#Page_10'>10</a>, that Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, while obtaining
data for her monograph on the question of rest for women, found that of 246
women only 56+ per cent were in good health. The American statistics were
compared with the results obtained in an investigation of the condition of 1,032
working women of Boston, made by the Massachusetts bureau of statistics of
labor; the comparison showed that the health of college women was more satisfactory
than the health of working women. The English statistics were compared
with the health statistics of 450 sisters or first cousins who had not received
a college education, and it was found that, at all periods, about 5 per cent less of
honor graduates were in bad health than of sisters and cousins. The comparative
tables showed that the married graduates were healthier than their married
sisters, that there were fewer childless marriages among them, that they had a
larger proportion of children per year of married life, and that their children
were healthier.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f48'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r48'>48</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The health, marriage rate, birth rate, etc., of woman graduates will be compared
in every case with the corresponding statistics for the women relatives
nearest in age who have not received a college education; an attempt will also be
made to obtain corresponding statistics for the nearest men relatives who are
college graduates.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r49'>49</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The health investigation of English women students showed that the average
age of marriage for students was 26.70 as against 25.53 for sisters, and that 10.25
per cent of the students were married and 19.33 per cent of the sisters, or, omitting
the students who had just left college when the returns were sent in, about
12 per cent of students. The rate of marriage of students after their college
course was completed and of their sisters seemed to be the same, the difference in
the total number of marriages being apparently accounted for by causes existing
before the termination of the college course, “possibly the desire to go to college,
or to remain in college may be among them, but having been in college is not one
of them.” (See summary of results by Mrs. Sidgwick, page 59.) Mrs. Sidgwick
concludes as a result of the investigation that not more than one-half of English
women of the social class of women students or their sisters marry. The American
investigation of 1883 showed that 27.8 per cent of the American college graduates,
their average age being 28½ years, were at that time married, and that,
judging by the indications of the marriage percentages among older graduates,
about 50 per cent were likely sooner or later to be married. In an investigation
of the marriage of Vassar graduates made in 1895, and not including the graduates
of that year, it was found that rather under 38 per cent of the whole number of
students, and about 63 per cent of the first four classes, were married, see
Frances M. Abbott: A Generation of college women, The Forum, vol. XX, p. 378.
Out of the total number of 8,956 graduates, including those graduating in June,
1899, of the 16 colleges belonging to the Association of collegiate alumnæ that
have kept accurate marriage statistics, 2,059 are married, or 23.0 per cent.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r50'>50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mrs. Sidgwick’s investigation showed that 77 per cent of all English students
reporting, and 83 per cent of honor students, had engaged in educational work.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r51'>51</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Between 1890 and 1898 women undergraduate students have increased 111.8
per cent, and men undergraduate students have increased 51.2 per cent.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f52'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r52'>52</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the college departments of coeducational colleges the average number of
women studying is 48.4, whereas in the college departments of independent women’s
colleges the average number of women studying is 331.91, and in affiliated colleges
192.8. In 1897–98 11.4 per cent of all the women studying in coeducational
colleges obtained the bachelor’s degree, whereas 13.4 per cent of all the women
studying in independent women’s colleges obtained the bachelor’s degree, which
indicates probably that women prefer women’s colleges for four years of residence.
In the same year 13.3 per cent of all men undergraduate students obtained
the bachelor’s degree. The average number of graduates of the 4 women’s colleges
belonging to the Association of collegiate alumnæ is 1,309 per college, the
average age of the colleges being 23 years; the average number of graduates of
the 15 coeducational colleges belonging to the Association of college alumnæ is
only 469.9, although the average age of the colleges is 27.7 years. During the 8
years from 1890 to 1898, women undergraduate students have increased in coeducational
colleges 105.4 per cent, whereas they have increased in women’s colleges,
division A, 138.4 per cent. Precisely the reverse is true of men students (see

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
